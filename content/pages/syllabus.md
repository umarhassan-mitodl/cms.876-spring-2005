Course Description
------------------

History of Media and Technology addresses the mutually influential histories of communications media and technological development, focusing on the shift from analog to digital cultures that began mid-century and continues to the present. The approach the series takes to the study of media and technology is a multifaceted one that includes theoretical and philosophical works, histories canonical and minority, literature and art, as well as hands-on production issues toward the advancement of student projects and research papers. Each course in the series reflects a particular thematic in the history of media and technology.

Eternal War asks whether war has historically been a progressive factor in relation to the development of new technologies and media systems. It uses documents by contemporary war theorists and historians, novelists, and theorists of technology and warfare and engages various media including film, gaming and news.

Lab time will be spent primarily on media such as film and television representation of the seminar subject. Lab time will also provide a more casual context for further discussion of issues raised in seminar.
